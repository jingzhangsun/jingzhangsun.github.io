I am currently an Associate Researcher at Hainan University since 2023, working on [Nuclear Medicine Image Processing, Medical Physics, and Artificial Intelligence-based Security](https://scs.hainanu.edu.cn/info/1051/2659.htm). Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Macau, advised by [Prof. Greta S.P. Mok](https://big.fst.um.edu.mo/) at Biomedical ImaginG Laboratory (BIG) in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Smart Medical Imaging Laboratory (SMILab) consists of ten members at present. To date, we have had 2 abstracts accepted at the annual meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), as well as 2 summaries accepted at the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC), including 1 oral presentation (To be updated).
